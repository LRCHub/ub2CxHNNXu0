Tell me my hero what do we need
To end it all, yeah and to never let us bleed
So hit me on the ground without a sound
Bring it on now till the day we take the lead

In the middle of the fake game, the same proclaims
Made by the liars from the lost age
Try to believe to know what you are
But you are not sure which side you're on from the start

Take a look, all the junk we made
The last corner you'll take will never lead you to the pearly gates
What else did we betray?
Turn into a machine
We just gave it away to fit into the scene

Are you losing your way or are you lost
Where are you going？

Tell me my hero where you're going
What do I need to end my war
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Shinji yorokobi kanae wakachiai
Subete o sute ima tachimukau

Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Demolition of the world we know
The natural selection that was all ineluctable
Now you see what a beautiful view
When everything is in the right place
Nothing's left to improve

What else did we betray?
Turn into a machine
We just gave it away to fit into the scene

Are you losing your way or are you lost
Where are you going?

Tell me my hero where you're going
What do I need to end my war
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Ikari uragiri itami aragai
Nageki keshitemo sono saki wa nai

Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Say can't you see we all know they wanted to see tomorrow
Say can't you see no one ever wanted to live in sorrow
Say can't you see we all know we wanted to be

Tell me my hero where you're going
What do I need to end my war
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Shinji yorokobi kanae meguriai
Kitto mata itsuka sou kimi ni au

Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground

Shinji yorokobi kanae meguriai
Kitto mata itsuka sou kimi ni au

Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground
